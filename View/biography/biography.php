<h1>Biography</h1>
<div>
    <p class="presentation">Talking about the basic elements of one’s life is an exercise in futility, but for the sake
        of introducing myself properly, I will say that you can call me Dino, I’m French-Moroccan and as I’m writing
        this intro, I am pushing 41 and am a father of two beautiful girls. I’m also an English teacher.</p>
    <p class="presentation">And so as a regular user of the English language in my job as well as in my principal hobby,
        which is film reviewing: I have always been fascinated by the term “director”. This notion of direction seems
        fundamental to me: a director does more than create, he takes a group of people under his wing and directs them
        towards a personal vision. He observes, anticipates, gets the best from each talent, establishes his vision
        without ceasing to listen, enriching it, killing a few darlings but whatever happens, he directs.</p>
    <p class="presentation">He might not be in the same league than Spielberg or Tarantino, but if the leadership skills
        are great, so will be the outcome. But again, it's all in the direction… and before leading others, you
        obviously have to learn how to lead yourself. And for me that was a long and harrowing journey, I was directed
        by my parents, then my studies, then financial necessities, then my work. At 27, I had everything to lead a
        stable and conventional life but then my passion for the movies started directing me.</p>
    <p class="presentation">It encouraged me to be more interested in films as works of art, as assemblages of sounds
        and images with a meaning behind them. It started with a collection of films that increased tenfold each year,
        then like the child who wants to become a footballer watching Zidane or Ronaldo, I was dreaming of emulating
        Coppola and Scorsese. I learned about software like Photoshop, Cool Edit Pro and Final Cut, I made promotional
        films for the companies where I worked. Little by little, cinema took more place in my life that I ever
        anticipated, until it compromised my jobs. I then took scriptwriting then directing courses by correspondence. I
        also watched at least five movies a week, reviewing each one in my IMDb page.</p>
    <p class="presentation">Here is my reviews page: <a class="click" href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4234119/reviews" title="My reviews page">click here</a></p>
    <p class="presentation">I was able to touch the professional world from time to time, but the various contacts I had
        made me aware of a shattering reality: it is very difficult to break into the cinema and I had neither the means
        nor the networks, let alone the luck, to start a project, however 'minimal' it was. It's a world of egos but
        it's also a domain that requires a certain rigor and flawless organization, and as I stated in my introduction,
        this is the closest I can get to concretizing a dream of being significant in the world of cinema: publishing
        reviews in a personal website.</p>
    <p class="presentation">It’s worth what it’s worth but I’m glad that after more than ten years, I had the nerve and
        the perseverance to fulfill that project, it might be the last, it might be a first, but I’m satisfied enough
        and I hope that will bring its share of satisfaction.</p>
